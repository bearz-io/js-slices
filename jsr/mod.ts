/**
 * ## Overview
 *
 * Slices enable working with slices of an array without resizing or
 * creating new arrays in most cases.  Instead, new slices are
 * created that that allows one to work with a segment of the
 * array.
 *
 * They are not as effecient as go's `slice` or .NET's `Span<T>`, but
 * they do provide some benefits for dealing with smaller segments
 * of arrays or character slices.
 *
 * The CharSlice and ReadOnlyCharSlice are specialized slice types
 * for working with string characters in their uint32 codepoint format
 * and provide string like methods such as trim, indexof, toUpper,
 * toLower, includes, and more without the need to convert them
 * back into strings to perform those operations.
 *
 * The CharSlice and ReadOnlyCharSlice allow you to work with
 * strings without allocating multiple copies of immuatable strings
 * and allow you to make multiple transforms  before
 * converting back to a string.
 *
 * The case insensitive formats of methods end with "Fold" which
 * are based upon go's `SimpleFold` and `EqualFold` methods. For
 * example: `equalFold`, `startsWithFold`, `endsWithFold`, `indexOfFold`
 * perform case insensitive comparisons over strings or CharSliceLike
 * objects such as CharSlice or Uint32Arrays.
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * from slices from '@bearz/slices'
 *
 * console.log(slices.equalIgnoreCase("left", "LeFT")); // true
 * console.log(slices.trimEnd("my random text...", ".")); // my random text
 * console.log(slices.underscore("first-place")); // first_place
 *
 * var sb = new slices.CharArrayBuilder()
 * sb.append("test")
 *    .append(new TextEncoder().encode(": another test"));
 *
 * // faster
 * sb.appendString("test")
 *   .appendUtf8Array(new TextEncoder().encode(": another test"))
 *
 * console.log(sb.toString())
 * ```
